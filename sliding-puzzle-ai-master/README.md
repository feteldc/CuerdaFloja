# Sliding puzzle game with 2 AI algorithms.

I attempted to create a virtual version of the sliding puzzle game, by using Python as the programming language. The program has a graphical user interface (GUI) and allows moves by clicking. It also keeps track and displays the number of moves made during a game. The state of the game can be set with the help of a CSV file. I implemented the breadth first search and best first search algortihms to solve the sliding puzzle.
